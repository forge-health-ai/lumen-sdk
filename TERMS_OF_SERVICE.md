4.1 **Not a Medical Device.** LUMEN is not a medical device within the meaning of the Food and Drugs Act (Canada), R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (U.S.), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h). LUMEN is not Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) under Health Canada or FDA frameworks. LUMEN has not been reviewed, cleared, or approved by Health Canada, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or any other regulatory authority.

4.2 **Not Clinical Decision Support.** LUMEN does not provide, and shall not be construed as providing: (a) clinical decision support; (b) medical advice, diagnoses, or treatment recommendations; (c) patient triage or risk stratification; (d) drug interaction analysis; or (e) any function that directly influences, recommends, or determines clinical care for any individual patient.

4.3 **Not Legal or Compliance Advice.** LUMEN does not provide legal advice. LUMEN Scores, Policy Pack evaluations, and Assurance Certificates do not constitute: (a) legal opinions; (b) compliance certifications or attestations; (c) regulatory audit reports; (d) representations of compliance with any law, regulation, or standard; or (e) substitutes for advice from qualified legal counsel.

4.4 **Governance Tool Only.** LUMEN is a governance support tool that generates informational indicators to assist organizations in documenting and evaluating the governance posture of AI-assisted decisions. LUMEN Scores reflect alignment with configured Policy Packs at the time of evaluation and are subject to the limitations, currency, and completeness of those Policy Packs.

4.5 **No Guarantee of Regulatory Acceptance.** Forge Partners makes no representation or warranty that any regulatory body, court, tribunal, accreditation body, auditor, or government agency will accept LUMEN artifacts (including Scores, Records, and Certificates) as sufficient evidence of compliance, due diligence, or governance.

4.6 **Clinical Outcomes.** Forge Partners bears no responsibility whatsoever for any clinical outcomes, patient harm, adverse events, near-misses, misdiagnoses, treatment errors, medication errors, delayed treatment, or any other healthcare-related consequences — whether arising directly or indirectly from: (a) reliance on LUMEN Scores; (b) decisions made using systems evaluated by LUMEN; (c) failure to act on LUMEN outputs; or (d) any other use or non-use of LUMEN Services.

5.2 **No Patient PII.** You shall not submit to LUMEN Services any PII of patients, research subjects, or other individuals whose data is subject to healthcare privacy laws.

5.4 **No Business Associate Relationship.** Forge Partners is not a "Business Associate" as defined under HIPAA, 45 C.F.R. § 160.103. Forge Partners is not a "Health Information Custodian" or "Agent" as defined under PHIPA. No Business Associate Agreement (BAA) or equivalent data processing agreement for PHI is offered, implied, or in effect. Your submission of PHI to LUMEN Services constitutes a breach of this Agreement.

5.5 **Breach Remedies.** If You submit PHI or patient PII to LUMEN Services in violation of this Section 5: (a) Forge Partners may immediately suspend or terminate Your access; (b) Forge Partners will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such data upon discovery; (c) You are solely responsible for any breach notification obligations under applicable law; and (d) You shall indemnify Forge Partners for all costs, damages, fines, and liabilities arising from such submission.
